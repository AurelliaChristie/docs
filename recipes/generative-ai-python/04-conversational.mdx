<Note>
    This article is part 4 of the Generative AI for Finance series, and is written using LangChain 0.3.0 (released on 14th September 2024). 
    
    For best results, it is recommended to consume the series in order, starting from [chapter 1](/recipes/generative-ai-python/01-background).
    
    For continuity purposes, I will point out the key differences between the current version (featuring `ReAct-style agent) and the older implementations featuring `AgentExecutor` (in [chapter 1](/recipes/generative-ai-python/01-background) and [chapter 2](/recipes/generative-ai-python/02-tool-use)).
