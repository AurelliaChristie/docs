<Note>
    This article is part 4 of the Generative AI for Finance series, and is written using LangChain 0.3.0 (released on 14th September 2024). 
    
    For best results, it is recommended to consume the series in order, starting from [chapter 1](/recipes/generative-ai-python/01-background).
    
    For continuity purposes, I will point out the key differences between the current version (featuring `ReAct-style agent) and the older implementations featuring `AgentExecutor` (in [chapter 1](/recipes/generative-ai-python/01-background) and [chapter 2](/recipes/generative-ai-python/02-tool-use)).

## Tool Use LangGraph Agents
Part 4 of this series will feel familiar to readers who have gone through the materials in [chapter 2](/recipes/generative-ai-python/02-tool-use), with the addition of the `LangGraph` library and 
a prebuilt ReAct agent that comes with LangGraph.

To make use of the `LangGraph` library, you will need to install it:

```bash
pip install langgraph
```

LangGraph is a library by LangChain, intended for more complex agentic systems and greater control 
than LangChain's agents. The orchestration isn't much different from what you have seen up to 
this point, so let us walk this process through:

1. Setting up our secrets
2. Creating our tools with the `@tool` decorator
