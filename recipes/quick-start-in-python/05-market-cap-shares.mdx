Market capitalization, a.k.a market cap, is the total value of a publicly traded company's oustanding common shares owned by stockholders. 
To determine whether a stock is considered "good enough", you might want to look at its market cap.
However, you might need the certain data to conduct the analysis.
Thus, [Sectors](https://sectors.app/) provides this data so you can do the analysis on your own!

## Install Required Libraries

- Install the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to make HTTP Requests
- Install [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) to do some data exploratory
- In this recipe we will use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to do the data visualization
- This is not a library, but you will need your [Sector API Keys](https://sectors.app/api) for this recipe

In order to install the required libraries, you can follow this command

```
pip install requests
pip install pandas
```

## Data Exploration

First thing first, we need to import the libraries that we are going to use on this recipe.

```python
import requests
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

In this recipe, we will use the **Companies by Subindustry** and **Company Report** from Sectors.
First, the **Companies by Subindustry** endpoints is to retrieve all the companies in the bank subindustry. Since we are going to do analysis on the bank industry, we can use the **banks** subindustry.

```python
API_KEYS = "Your API Keys"
headers = {
    "Authorization": API_KEYS
}

response = requests.get("https://api.sectors.app/v1/companies/?sub_industry=banks", headers = headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    companies_data = response.json()
else:
  # Handle error
  print("Error Status :",response.status_code)
```

If you try to print the `companies_data`, the displayed data would be look like this.

```
['BNBA.JK',
 'BVIC.JK',
 'BMAS.JK',
 'BJTM.JK',
 'NISP.JK',
 ...
 'BEKS.JK',
 'BCIC.JK']
```

We are going to need to symbol of each company. So we need to do a little process for the `companies_data` to remove the ".JK" substring.

```python
for i in range (len(companies_data)):
  companies_data[i] = companies_data[i].replace(".JK", "")
```

If you try to print the `companies_data` again, the displayed data would be look like this.

```
['BNBA',
 'BVIC',
 'BMAS',
 'BJTM',
 ...
 'BEKS',
 'BCIC']
```

Then, for all the companies in the `companies_data`, we will try to retrieve the market cap data.
In this case we will use the **Company Report** endpoint. For the report section, we can use the **overview** section.
Since we will retrieve a lot of data from the endpoint, we will set **one second timeout** for each request.
This is done to **avoid Error 429 responds (Too Many Requests)** from the server.
This process might take up to 1 minute.

```
import time

headers = {
    "Authorization": API_KEYS
}

result_data = []
for company in companies_data:
  response = requests.get(f"https://api.sectors.app/v1/company/report/{company}/?sections=overview", headers = headers)

  if response.status_code == 200:
      data = response.json()
      result_data.append(data)
      time.sleep(1)
  else:
    # Handle error
    print("Error Status :",response.status_code)

```

## Data Processing

If you try to print the `result_data`, it would some sort of complicated and nested data.  
Therefore, we would like to process the data first to make it more readable.
This process will extract the needed data from the `result_data`. In this recipe, we will only use the **symbol** and **market_cap** data.

```python
processed_data = []
for data in result_data:
  market_cap_data = dict()
  market_cap_data['symbol'] = data['symbol']
  market_cap_data['market_cap'] = data['overview']['market_cap']
  processed_data.append(market_cap_data)
```

If you try to print the `processed_data`, the data will be displayed like this.

```
[{'symbol': 'BNBA.JK', 'market_cap': 2049739325440},
 {'symbol': 'BVIC.JK', 'market_cap': 1004160024576},
 {'symbol': 'BMAS.JK', 'market_cap': 9413404393472},
 {'symbol': 'BJTM.JK', 'market_cap': 7730085494784},
 {'symbol': 'NISP.JK', 'market_cap': 28222718738432},
 ...
]
```

To make the visualization more readable, we need to limit the amount of the data.
Therefore, in this recipe, we will use the top 5 companies to be visualized.
In order to get the top 5 data, we need to split the data first. 
Then, the rest of the data will be combined and grouped as **"Others"**.
Finally, the data will be concated again after the calculation.

```python
# To be adjusted
number = 5

sorted_data = sorted(processed_data, key=lambda x: x['market_cap'], reverse=True)
sorted_data

# Split the data
top_data = sorted_data[:number]
rest_data = sorted_data[number:]

# Combine Data
accumulative_market_cap = 0
for data in rest_data:
  accumulative_market_cap += data['market_cap']

# Concat the calculation result
top_data.append({"symbol": "Others", "market_cap": accumulative_market_cap})
```

If you try to print the `top_data`, the data will be displayed like this.

```
[{'symbol': 'BBCA.JK', 'market_cap': 1161866902503424},
 {'symbol': 'BBRI.JK', 'market_cap': 643877539151872},
 {'symbol': 'BMRI.JK', 'market_cap': 555333130911744},
 {'symbol': 'BBNI.JK', 'market_cap': 163889425678336},
 {'symbol': 'BRIS.JK', 'market_cap': 113602497347584},
 {'symbol': 'Others', 'market_cap': 502623818743808}]
```

## Data Visualization

Before visualizing, we are going to transform the data type into a **DataFrame**.

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(top_data)
```

Then, we visualize it using **matplotlib** library.
```python
plt.pie(df['market_cap'], labels=df['symbol'], autopct='%1.0f%%')
```

The visualization should be displayed like this.

## Conclusion
With this recipe, you can now perform your own analysis to decide whether a stock is volatile.
Not only limited to market cap shares, you can do comparative analysis on various data, such as revenues, gross profit, growth, and many more!
You only need to adjust the data you retrieve from [Sectors](https://sectors.app/).
